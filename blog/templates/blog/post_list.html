            <h2><a href="">My first post</a></h2>
            <p> Hey human reading this! WELCOME. I hope you are a human. As far as I know homosapiens are the only literate species.</p>
My name is Caitlin Barnes. I am 15 years old and go to San Marin Highschool in Novato, California. I love to read, eat delicious food, and swim in the ocean.
Currently I am exploring  my interest for computer science. So many people use the internet daily but have no clue how it works. I am enrolled in a Girls Who Code summer immersion program at a software company called Pivotal.
Thanks for reading my first blog post. Apprecitate the cheerful moments in life and learn, learn, learn!

            <p> What's something you are interested in learning? My answer is sign language. I want to do it but I can be lazy, so I make the excuse that I don't have the time. Bad! Be proactive and take 15 minutes today to learn something new. </p>
